    "body": "Superstars have been 1 of my favorite running shoes for many years. I remember them from the 1980s but never being able to get them. When they came out again in the late 1990s/early 2000s I started to but them again, and I love them. They are super easy to wear & comfy, and easily accommodate orthotics (I have worn orthotics for over 30 years for flat feet). My Adidas Superstars go well with almost anything - jeans & t-shirt, tracksuit, or shorts. They are great for everyday use and I have found them great for playing tennis as well. They grip the court well and I can change direction easily in them. I am very happy with these shoes!",

I recommend going to a store that sells Adidas shoes and trying on Superstars to find your correct size, especially if you're buying women's shoes. I go a full size down (8.5 regular to 7.5 for Adidas) . Customized shoes cannot be returned, even if they don't fit. Overall, great price and worth it to have a unique pair of shoes!",

I immediately love that this color goes with so many of my spring outfits and super comfortable to wear for long walks. I'm a size 8.5 in adidas sneakers, but i went with everyone's recommendations to size down and I'm glad I did because they fit perfect with the size 8. Easy to wipe clean as well. Would love to see more of these styles with other pastel colors for Spring/Summer vibes.",

They both sell out real fast..so I bought 2pairs..couldn't get my hands on a single pair for months. Tried adidas stores, random stockists & of course online. These are the coolest shoes & I had to have a pair! You can wear them with everything & anything. As soon as I saw they were available again online.. I wasn't going to miss out..so I bought 2pairs the same! Recommend you superstars do the same if you want the coolest shoe in your wardrobe..I guarantee them to be a fave for years. Time to take these babies for a walk!",

I’ve owned adidas superstars before and these are constructed different- the tongue is made of a thin leather and is longer than normal. I wore them once and it cut the front of both my ankles. I spoke to someone from adidas expressing my discomfort and their response was “because I have worn them once, there is nothing they can do”. This response was extremely frustrating, as I would not have uncovered this had I not worn them. Even though I’ve always been a customer and an avid fan of adidas, this experience has me doubting that I’ll ever shop here again.",
