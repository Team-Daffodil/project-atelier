## Usage

To build project-atelier:

```bash
$npm install
$npm run build:production
```

Build files can be found in `.dist/` folder. We suggest using nginx to serve the files.

## Requirements

- npm
- nginx/apache to serve static files.

## Development

The first step is to fork the project and set the upstream to Team Daffodil's main repo:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Team-Daffodil/project-atelier.git
```

Verify upstream was added:

```bash
$ git remote -v

origin  https://github.com/<github_handle>/project-atelier.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/<github_handle>/project-atelier.git (push)
upstream        https://github.com/Team-Daffodil/project-atelier.git (fetch)
upstream        https://github.com/Team-Daffodil/project-atelier.git (push)
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Creating a Pull Request

Procedure:

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>       # work on a new branch on your fork.
git add <files>                     # add changed files.
git commit -m 'descriptive message' # write a descriptive commit message.
git checkout main                   # switch to main branch
git pull upstream main              # pull latest changes from upstream before committing.
git merge <branch-name>             # merge new branch to main, make sure to resolve any merge conflicts before pushing.
git push                            # push to your fork

# Go to your fork on Github and initiate a pull request.
```
